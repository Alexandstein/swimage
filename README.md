Swift Image Helper
==================
SwImage, the Swift Helper Library is a library for Cocoa (and potentially Cocoa Touch) I'm currently writing for my own purposes to assist in 
with simple image modification functionality one would see in, for example, the Python image library, due to
the complexity in setting up a lot of background and setup code used to generate image data using Cocoa.
